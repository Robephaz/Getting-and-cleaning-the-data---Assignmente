Assignment in R for Getting and cleaning the data course

This is the course project for Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera. Code is written in R in file. Source file is run_analysis.R. This R script does the following things:

Download the dataset.
Check if zip has already been downloaded in ./projectData directory?
Check if zip has already been unzipped?
List all the files of UCI HAR Dataset folder The files that will be used to load data are listed as follows: test/subject_test.txt test/X_test.txt test/y_test.txt train/subject_train.txt train/X_train.txt train/y_train.txt

Load activity, subject and feature info. Read data from the files into the variables.

Read the Activity files.
Read the Subject files.
Read Features files.
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Concatenate the data tables by rows.
set names to variables.
Merge columns to get the data frame Data for all data.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Subset Name of Features by measurements on the mean and standard deviation.
Subset the data frame Data by selected names of Features.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

Read descriptive activity names from activity_labels.txt
Factorize variable activity in the data frame Data using descriptive activity names.
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

Creates a independent tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

Final output file is tidy_data.txt
